## About

This project is to create a base template and include some common commands in the docs/Resources.md to allow utilization of this project as a baseline for future projects.

This project is intended to meet the requirements of PEP-518 and PEP-621, removing the setup.py file. It also relies on Ruff for linting and formatting support.
